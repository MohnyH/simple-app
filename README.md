# Let's get started

before you go, I just implemented a few improvements and bug fixes at the core and I created this repository for beginners only, right?
So I don't recommend that using this libraries and frameworks for large scale applications at all, here we go!

* What's this:

This is simple cross-platform app based on React and Ionic framework (WEB/PWA/iOS/Android/Desktop).
Also note that I've no support for this project, but everything works perfectly!
You can use this template in all platforms by their default system settings and user interfaces.

* How can I add platforms:

- $ npx cap add android
- $ npx cap add ios
- $ npx cap add electron

you can also generate your App Icon and splash screens using:
- $ cordova-res --skip-config --copy

* Installation:

- clone the repository 
- $ ionic serve

* Next:
Don't worry about anything, all prefixes are applied, clone and enjoy!
